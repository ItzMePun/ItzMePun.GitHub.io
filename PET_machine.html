                    <p>
                       This project started with my purchase of a 3D printer. When I first got 
                       a 3D printer it came with about 250g of filament which went through 
                       relatively quickly. After researching about filament to find what is the 
                       best option and general knowledge about filament to come to a conclusion 
                       on what I should buy, I also came to a conclusion that filament was kinda expensive. 
                       Living in Thailand, where single use plastic is a big issue that is not 
                       really being addressed due to it's convenience and low costs, I thought 
                       "why can't I just 3D print with this stuff", and so it began.

                    <p>
                        First, I thought that since simple FDM printers like the one I had 
                        can use more than one material, maybe the materials used in plastic 
                        bottles can be used to 3D print as well. I learned that drink bottles 
                        generally use PET for the most part but some also use HDPE for products 
                        containing dairy. Then, I discovered that there were already many 
                        videos on the subject that can help direct me. This was a great help 
                        as it would guide me along with the project especially since at this 
                        point I have had little to no experience with constructing my own 
                        electronic circuits, I had been strictly software.

                        After looking through many iterations of the project, I looked 
                        online to order the parts and ran into a problem, the parts I 
                        saw in the tutorials were much more expensive than anticipated. 
                        So, I returned to research the specs of what was available and 
                        within my price range. This led to me having components that were 
                        not what I expected and some that also did not operate as expected 
                        as I did not have a good understanding of machine specifications. 
                        In the process of trial and error, I was able to learn a few things 
                        about electronics and also how not to short circuit the mains in my 
                        house. Due to a lack of equipment that would've allowed me to 
                        prototype such as a breadboard or stripboard and solder, the things 
                        I was able to do was limited. In hindsight, it would have been a 
                        good idea to invest in those things to speed the process along.

                        In the end, the project did work for a short amount of time. The machine 
                        was able to convert roughly 6 litre bottles into filament that can be used 
                        for 3D printing. However, after the sixth bottle, some of the gears on the 
                        machine broke under load and so my efforts were directed towards fixing 
                        said issue. Before I was able to fix the issue, exam season came around 
                        and so I decided to stop working on it. To continue this project I will 
                        need to learn about gears and more general design principles.

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    This project has taught me many practical experiences about working 
                    with electronics as well as practical designs. It has taught me to 
                    problem solve but also show me the potential of what I can do with 
                    determination and the resources I have on hand. The project has been 
                    a great learning experience for me so far and I do plan on continuing 
                    this project to achieve the desired outcome as well as improve upon it.
