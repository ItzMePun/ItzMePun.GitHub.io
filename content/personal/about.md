I am a university student studying Electronic and Computer Engineering at the University of Nottingham. As an engineering student, I am constantly problem solving both in my degree and in everyday life. I'm a programmer most proficient in python and c++. My technical skills have also extended beyond theory and simulation and into physical electronic systems. I'm always on the lookout for an opportunity to improve and become better in the topics that interests me.
