                    <h3>Starting Point</h3>
                    <p>
                        Towards the start of year 12, I grew an interest in machine learning.
                        This was sparked in part by the release of Chat GPT and the initial
                        talk surrounding the topic. My first time looking into this was by 
                        watching Youtube explainers and reading through the library websites.

                    <h4>My first project</h4>
                    <p>
                        My first project was to predict what genre of music someone will like
                        based on their age and gender. It was a very basic model that used a
                        regression tree classifier to make a prediction. Although the project
                        was very short, it taught me some of the very basics and foundation to
                        machine learning. It also taught me how to use the notebook environment 
                        and other tools essential to development.

                    <h4>Following projects</h4>
                    <p>
                        Following that, I made a few more projects on my own to independantly
                        improve my coding abilities. The projects had very basic concepts and
                        utilises some of the simpler machine learning models such as linear regression 
                        Decision Trees and Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN). The projects usually
                        had a small data set to train width and data was mainly taken from <a href="">Kaggle</a>.
                        This resulted in models that had relatively low accuracy and not much new data to 
                        test it on.

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    My first several steps into machine learning have taught me many things.
                    Despite most of them ending up with sub-par or even poor results, the 
                    objective was to learn from them, and that was a success. Through 
                    learning with these projects, my knowledge both with machine learning 
                    and coding in general has expanded and it has allowed me to apply 
                    my knowledge in other projects later on such as the project with 
                    <a href="Chula_ML_Project.html" target="_blank">Chula</a>. The learning experience 
                    has also taught me things beyond the scope of each project such as the 
                    skills to research and find answers for my self as well as to adapt to 
                    the challenge. These skills have stuck with me through most future 
                    projects and will surely continue to as well. <br> The projects metioned 
                    and others can be seen on my <a href="https://github.com/ItzMePun" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
