                    <h3>Starting Point</h3>
                    <p>
                        For a period of time, I was very interested in the Tetris speedruns 
                        which led to an interest in the end of the game of Tetris. This led to 
                        me wanting to take a step into game design and making a game from scratch.
                        So, I took on building Tetris
                    </p>

                <div class="block2-left">
                    <h4>My first project</h4>
                    <p>
                        For this project, I tried to limit myself from using tutorial videos and 
                        that type of material/resource that would simply do the work for me. Instead, 
                        I decided to use the pygame library and attempted to build the game from the 
                        little experience I had and learn as I go. The project moved along smoothly 
                        at first. I would search up how to do specific things in order to accomplish 
                        the goal for things I didn't know how to do or for functions I didn't know 
                        how to use. A lot of the project was designing and redesigning the logic behind 
                        the game based on what functions were available to me and the functions I knew 
                        how to use.
                    </p>

                <div class="block2-right"><img src="portfolio_pages/Tetris_imgs/Tetris play.png" alt="chula img"></div>
            </div>

            <div class="block block3">
                <div class="block3-left"><img src="portfolio_pages/Tetris_imgs/My screenshot.png" alt="chula img"></div>
                <div class="block3-mid">
                    <h4>Following projects</h4>
                    <p>
                        After hitting a major roadblock for the project where I was unable to think 
                        of a solution to move forwards, I decided to look at examples of the game 
                        made by others in hopes of adapting certain features into my own code. This 
                        was a very helpful resource utilized as it greatly accelerated the games creation 
                        and helped me continue forwards. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="block3-right">
                    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                    <p> 
                        In the end, despite only being able to create a barebones version of the 
                        game that is still missing parts of it, I deem the project to be at least 
                        a half success in that it helped me progress forwards with my coding abilities 
                        and also my problem solving skills. I was able to learn how to adapt to the 
                        limited resources I had and work off of them to produce a result. The project 
                        can be seen on my <a href="https://github.com/ItzMePun">GitHub</a> along with my other projects.
