                    <h3>The Introduction</h3>
                    <p>
                        The EEEBot is a coursework project for the first year of my Electronic 
                        and Computer Engineering degree. The EEEBot is a robotic car that is 
                        controlled by an ESP32. The project spanend the course of the academic year 
                        and was work on in 5 separate lab weeks. From start to finish, it began 
                        as a simple car that can be controlled by a pre loaded program and given 
                        more capabilities through various sensors along the way. Prior to this 
                        project I have had very limited experiece with electronic components 
                        and while I understood the theory, I was lacking in practical experience.
                        The project helped me develop my skills and will hopefully help me with 
                        various projects in the future.

                    <h3>Blind Maze Navigation</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first sensors added to the EEEBot after it's contruction was a sonar 
                        and an MPU. The sonar used was an HC-SR04 sonar sensor that was used to 
                        give it the ability to measure it's distance to a nearby object in front 
                        using sonar technology. The MPU used gave the EEEBot the ability to read 
                        angular velocity as well as acceleration. This gave it the ability to 
                        keep track of it's orientation. Using these two sensors, the goal for the 
                        week was to navigate a maze without crashing by hugging the left wall. 
                        This is a common method to solve a simple maze given that it does not need 
                        to be optimized. This was accomplished smoothly.

                    <h4>Line Following</h4>
                    <p>
                        Next, the EEEBot was equiped with an array of 5 photodiodes. These photo diodes 
                        would capture a reflected infrared ray from the ground and use this as input to 
                        perform line following. The outputs from the photodiodes would go through a 
                        transimpedance amplifier to make the readings more clear then go through an ADC.
                        The inputs from each sensor is weighted and then average to get a value to 
                        represent the diviation from the line. This value is then used to produce a 
                        weight value of how far the servo on the EEEBot should turn to correct it's path 
                        and perform said function. Out of all the weeks, this was the most successful, 
                        being able to perfectly follow the line and demonstrated it's workings.

                    <h3>Remote Control</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the next project week, a raspberry pi was integrated into the system of the 
                        EEEBot. This allowed for wireless communication and so wireless controll from 
                        a dashboard that can be accessed through a browser. This was straight forward, 
                        using the MQTT service which is designed for high latency wireless communications.

                    <h4>Symbol Recognition</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the final lab week, using a camera connected to the raspberry pi, the EEEBot 
                        was given the ability to perform symbol recognition. The camera feed would be 
                        used as input and the program would give an output that can be used to controll 
                        the EEEBot to move accordingly. Each frame of the input would first be filtered 
                        to leave only the relavent information, filtering out noise. The result would be 
                        used to create contours and get a set of coordinates to what should be the four 
                        corners of the symbol in frame. The original image is then warped to these coordinates 
                        and compared to a template of the symbols to produce a percentage match. This value 
                        determines which symbol is being seen or if a symbol is even in frame. This went 
                        well when in a controlled environment with proper lighting but failed to perform 
                        in a range of settings.

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    The EEEBot project for my coursework has taught me many things over the course of 
                    the year. This I consider to be my first proper intruction to electronics where 
                    I was able to learn step by step. While the EEEBot is relatively rudimentary in 
                    my opinion, using outdated software at times, it did serve it's purpose as an intro 
                    to the course. Using these skills, I plan to improve my previous projects over the 
                    course of the summer as well as embark on to new endevours. The EEEBot worked for 
                    most part as intended and was able to do the simple things it was required to 
                    albeit in a proof of concept kind of way and nowhere near industry level, the skills 
                    I learned will help me in the future. The project required me to write 3 technical 
                    reports which can be seen below.
