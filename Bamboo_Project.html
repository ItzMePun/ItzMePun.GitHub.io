                    <h3>What is the Bamboo Project?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Bamboo Project is a student led organization aimed at raising
                        awareness on recycling and how to be more environmentally friendly
                        is an easy way in our everyday lives. We try to educate the community
                        on how we could all become more environmentally friendly through our
                        social media platform and by partnering with local companies and organizations
                        to push our cause further.

                        I was one of the founding members of the Bamboo Project. My role in the
                        organization is to research into topics related to our cause and summarise
                        the information to be posted. On top of that I was also part of organizing
                        and running events such as food sales which were fund raisers.

                    <h4>What did we achieve?</h4>
                    <p>
                        We initially planed to hold a canal clean up with the organization
                        Terracycle Thai Foundation. However, due to the insufficient number
                        of people we managed to recruit and the hurdle of paperwork related
                        to the schools health and safety regualtions for field trips, the plan
                        sadly did not come to fruition.

                <div class="block4-left">
                    <p>
                        Despite that failure, we shifted our aim with the funds we had to partner
                        with Beyond Cancer. Together we sourced and provided care packages for children
                        with cancer that included everyday objects made from recycled plastic. This was
                        given to the children alongside financial help towards their treatment.

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    Through the two years of the project, despite many setbacks that
                    led to us not being able to fulfill our original goal to the degree
                    we had hoped, I feel that the impact we did make was at least a positive
                    one and in the direction we aimed for. Through this project, I have learnt
                    many skills such as to research and summarize a topic as well as t how to
                    contact other organizations formally. I really am grateful for the opportunities
                    we did have to do this.
                    Moving into the future, we decided to hand down the project to the next generation. 
                    We aim to have more realistic short term goals that could be built upon 
                    by later years. I hope that some day, it will become the organization we
                    all initially envisioned.
