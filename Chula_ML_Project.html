                    <h3>Project Objective</h3>
                    <p>The research project's objective was to identify the chemical
                        make up of sweat samples using Gas Chromatography - Ion Mobility
                        Spectrometry (GC-IMS). This info was then to be used to find
                        any patterns that could indicate the stages in a menstrual cycle
                        the subject is at. This is so that there could be a less intrusive
                        method of identification when it is needed.

                    <h4>Why Machine Learning?</h4>
                    <p>
                        My purpose on the project was to use build a machine learning model
                        that will be used to classify the data. By doing this, the process
                        of identifying patterns can be done more efficiently and the knowledge
                        can be applied more easily as it would not rely on needing a human that
                        can recognize the patterns. By using machine learning, new patterns in the
                        results could potentially be discovered to make the process more streamlined.

                    <h4>Input</h4>
                    <p>
                        Typically when using GC-IMS, the data is plotted onto a heat map
                        in order to make the numbers more comprehensible to the human mind.
                        In this scenerio, the data was given as the raw numbers. This
                        is because the computer can handle the data and we suspect it could even perform
                        better using the raw data as input, rather than an image plot of the data.
                        However, we also wanted to try using the images as input as it could
                        simplify the data and make patterns more recognizable to the model. 
                        In the end we tried to use both.

                <div class="block4-left">
                    <h4>Data Processing</h4>
                    <p>When using the raw data, it is a 2D array of floating point numbers
                        this can be utilise easily as it can be treated similarly to a 1D image
                        so a convolutional neural network (CNN) can be used.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="block4-right">
                    <h4 class="chula_hide">.</h4>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, the images were 3D arrays so a 2D CNN can be used.
                        we tried to simplify the data for both models by passing the a average pooling
                        and max pooling for numerical and image data respectively.

                    <h4>Model Building</h4>
                    <p>
                        When building the model, the library TensorFlow was used, along side
                        pandas to format the data. The first model used to process numerical data
                        had 2 average pooling layers and 4 dense layers with relu activation.
                        between the first 3 dense layers there were a dropout layer. The model used
                        RMSprop optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001 with binary cross entropy
                        as the loss function. The second model had two sets of 3 convolutional2d layers
                        followed by a max pooling layer. Then, the data was flattened and passed
                        through 2 dense layers. The same optimizer and loss functions were used.

                    <h4>Performance and conclusion</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the end, the model did not perform to the expected accuracy
                        , correctly classiflying only 60% of the given data for both
                        numerical and image datasets. The lack of training data available
                        as the samples were all manually gathered as well as the short deadline
                        resulted in our portion of the research to be scrapped from the final paper
                        that was submitted. This project may not be the most successful I have
                        completed but it did teach me how to work in the lab environment as well
                        as how to properly write a research paper and to properly cite my sources.
